# To-Do

* Fix the fact that this is using a python2 snippet. should be easy to translate to py3, I just didn't bother as I focused on writing my own code.
* Make it for Windows too
* Youtube-DL has a Python module. Use this instead of Sys-Call (how about mediainfo?)
* FIX EMOJIS: Unicode Emojis are not properly rendered by wkHTMLtoPDF. If you encounter this issue, use --no-pdf, open the ./out/YOUTUBE_ID/index.html and Print to PDF.
* In when parsing the Video Description, detect urls and add proper html-tags
